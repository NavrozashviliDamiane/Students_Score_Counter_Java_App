# Students_Score_Counter_Java_App

The provided code is a Java program that collects marks for a group of students and calculates the total number of students who passed and failed. Here's a description of the program for students:

The program allows you to input the number of students and their marks. It then determines how many students passed and how many failed based on a passing threshold of 50 marks. Here's how you can interact with the program:

When the program starts, it will ask you to enter the total number of students in the class. You should provide a positive whole number (e.g., 25) using the keyboard.

After entering the number of students, the program will prompt you to input the marks for each student. It will display a message like "Enter the marks for student 1:" and wait for you to enter the student's marks. You should enter a numeric value representing the marks obtained by that student and press Enter.

The program will check the entered marks. If the marks are 50 or above, it will consider the student as passing. If the marks are below 50, it will consider the student as failing.

After processing the marks for each student, the program will display the following information:

Total students: The number of students you initially entered.
Pass count: The number of students who achieved 50 marks or more.
Fail count: The number of students who obtained less than 50 marks.
Once the program displays the results, it will terminate.

Remember to enter valid integer values for the number of students and marks when prompted by the program.
